# Post Its!

Post Its is a quick notetaking app.  It lets a user write down notes extremely quickly, whether it's just fleeting thoughts or long rants.  Post Its is designed to be intuitive, minimalistic, and extremely fast to use, letting one get along with their day yet still having the convenience of documenting whatever they want.

I'm using the react native paper package for styling.  It looks good and I'm transitioning more and more of the app over to its components.  I'm using async storage to keep data persistent.  Icons also come from react native paper.  One focus is writing clean/re-usable code, with a big part of that being iterable lists that represent categories and comments.
